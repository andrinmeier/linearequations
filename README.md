# System of linear equations solver

This application allows solving systems of linear equations of arbitrary sizes.
The reason for this tool is that even though there are other offerings in this space (such as Wolfram Alpha), they all have some limitations, such as the maximum dimension of the matrix. That is why this tool allows you to specify arbitrary dimensions for matrices
and solves the linear equations easily and quickly.
