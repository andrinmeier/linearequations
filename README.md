# Linear Equations Solver

This tool uses numpy's linalg.solve to solve systems of linear equations. The web application is available under [Linear Equations](https://linear-equations.com).

## Technologies

The project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for the frontend. Tracking is done using [Plausible.js](https://plausible.io/). The actual equation solver runs as an Azure Function.
